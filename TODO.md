- UI kind of sucks
  - encode file types using colors (like windirstat)
  - prettier charts
  - better controls (zoom/pan) - mb animations
- use qstatemachine to switch between states? - app open states -> scanning -> finished / canceled -> etc...
- scanner spends most of time encoding strings between utf-16 (QString) and const char* (lstat) - in general getting file names from QDirIterator
